Project.  

Get map and filter working.  Need to be able to click both list and markets for more info.  

Need to use Knockout.js

Structure
__________________
Main view = Map - full screen.  
	Markets should all show up by default
Side view - hamburger
	List of markers, filter with top textbox.  

Keep all location info in a ViewModel, make marker objects be going through that list
side view simply displays those models 


Plan
- Start by getting a map on the screen - do SF.  Should not be able to zoom or anything, just look.  
- Then get ~15 locations on the map (dont worry about model quite yet, just get things showing)
	- use some famous SF places
